			<p class="lead"><br />My name is Rebecca Frank and I just moved to Seattle. Working at PicMonkey is my dream job. If I worked at PicMonkey right now, and you asked me for some tangible ways I would move the product forward, this is what I'd say.</p>

        <!-- First Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="about">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="./img/canvas2.jpg">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The First
                <span class="text-muted">Expand Canvas Size.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><b>Background</b><br />The ability to expand the canvas size would take PicMonkey beyond the world of photo editing and allow it to expand its audience of image creators. I see this as an extension of the current Design feature. Because I'm not privy to the demographic makeup of your userbase, I don't know what percentage would find this a win. But I have a hunch it would be big.<br /><br />In a world where the content-first strategy is trending and data visualization and infographics are favorites of every blogger and online entrepreneur, I think this would be a worthwhile feature. It could expand the market for paying customers since business owners would be more inclined to have a budget for image creation over the free photo editting features.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>How It Might Work</b><br />I would suggest adding this feature in the Basic Edits and change the second tab title to just “Canvas” instead of “Canvas Color”. Then, once it's expanded it would have multiple canvas related options, the current ones and the new resizing/additional canvas tool.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>The Current Hack</b><br />Right now I achieve a similar effect by going into Frames, slecting the Simple Edge, changing the inner and outer mats to white and increasing their thickness. Then after applying those changes, I go and crop the image again if the extra canvas was only needed on one side.</p>

        <div class="featurette" id="services">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="./img/tests.jpg">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Second
                <span class="text-muted">User Research on Apply v. Save</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><b>Background</b><br />If resources allowed, I would like to examine the use and placement of the Apply v. Save buttons. It might just be my own user quirk, but during times when I'm working quickly, I accidentally click Save instead of Apply. In my head I subconsciously think “save the edits I just made and continue working” not “finish and save”.<br /><br />The save functionality across many application does not close out the document, it simply ensures no progress is lost. Since PicMonkey uses a different definition from the standard use, it's tripped me up. Note: this might only be applicable to advanced or long-time users. New users might be moving slower and consciously reading the button copy but for those who are intimately familiar with the app and on auto-pilot they might mix these two buttons up.</p>		
			<p class="lead"><b>How It Might Work</b><br />Depending on resources, time, and budget constraints I would either conduct some user interviews, do some user testing sessions or create a social survey for current users to answer questions on the subject. We could even try out different versions of the button like "Save Changes" and "I'm Finished", etc. The data and responses collected could illuminate whether this is an area worth tweaking, potentially decreasing frustration and inefficiencies for users, or if I'm the only one in the world who keeps doing this :P.</p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="contact">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="./img/rulers.JPG">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Third
                <span class="text-muted">Rulers, Grids & Alignment.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><b>Background</b><br />I think this one could be a big win for PicMonkey. People would give a standing ovation and shed happy tears if some alignment features were built out. They could be rolled out over multiple releases, starting with the easiest, but even just providing rulers and grids could expand the use cases of the product greatly. The more complex feature of alignment snapping might even expand the business-user base and could increase sales if Visio type needs, like org-charts, process flows, and diagrams were possible.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>How It Might Work</b><br />This one might be simplest for the dev team to implement in phases. Adding side rulers and overlay grids could be a simple toggle feature. Perhaps it could live in the lower-right of the background near the zoom feature, since the rulers would be displayed in the background around the edge of the editing area. Probably a more challenging feature to implement, and one that would need more brainstorming to hash out the requirements for, is a snap-to-grid alignment feature. This could be added to individual tools like the current text, and overlays or it could warrant its own tab in the Basic Edits section called "Alignment" and include features to select multiple elements to align.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>The Current Hack</b><br />Now I'm warning you, this is really hacky. Like a good ol' game of hacky sack. What I do now if I need elements aligned, is add a geometric shape with 90&deg; angles, expand it to the length or width of my canvas and scoochy everything over to manually align things. Then I delete the overlay shape.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Reopen to Continue Editing.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I know this would be a big fish to fry but adding in the ability to reopen a file and still be able to tweak different layers would be total awesomesauce. Right now I simply start all over when I need to make an edit that the eraser can't help me with. This would probably take some long technical brainstorming but holy moly, if PicMonkey could pull this off then I think it could steal a huge marketshare from other editing platforms. Perhaps PicMonkey could have its own file extension, or maybe there is an existing format that could keep layers separate. I don't know, like I said, now I'm just dreaming. :)</p>

		<p class="lead">I'm sure you get a slew of feature requests from users. I know how that goes. In addition to the design and requirements responsibilities I had when I worked for the Veterans Affairs, I also oversaw the customer relations help desk for our project's web app. I'm familiar with how complicated it can be to assess priority, align with the company vision, prevent scope creep and then set out to design and implement. I simply wanted to show a quick example of my my thought process and usability ideas in a concrete way.</p>
